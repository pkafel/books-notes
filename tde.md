# The Daily Edge: Simple Strategies to Increase Efficiency (by David Horsager)

## 90 Day Quick Plan

90 days for a plan is a perfect length because it is long enought to make a difference but not too long to discourage you from execution of it. In order to make it work you need to answer the following 5 question:
* Where am I?
* Where am I going in 90 days? (make sure this is realistic and quantifiable)
* Why am I going? (the stronger the reason the bigger chance you will make it)
* How are we going to get there?
* How are we going to get there? (yes, again)
* How are we going to get there? (yes, again and again)

## DMA (Difference Making Actions)

DMA’s simply give focus and intentionality to do the most important things every day.

1. First thing every morning, take a sticky note.
2. At the top, write your most important current goal.
3. Then write the numbers 1-5 down the page.
4. Next to the 1, write the most important thing you could do today to accomplish that goal. Then write the next most important thing under 2, and so on.
5. You now have a list of the 5 most important things you could to today that would make the biggest difference in accomplishing your goal and ultimately fulfilling your organization’s mission.”

Make sure your DMA's are FUN:
* F - First priority first
* U - Under the main vision and current major objective
* N - Number attached (must be quantifiable)

## Power Hour

For 60 minutes each morning, we don’t do meetings, phone calls, or e-mails. To help it work:
* go public
* share the idea
* be consistent

## Focus

Working sequentially is way more effective than working on many things in parallel. Things that will help:
* stay focused on one thing at a time
* eliminate distractions
* keep sticky notes

## Decide now

Dont leave unimportant things for later. If at all possible do it, use it, throw it, or complete it now.

## SEEDS First

It is hard to accomplish a big goal if you are sick and tired:
* S -  Sleep
* E - Exercise
* E - Eat Right
* D - Drink Water
* S - Source (like for example God)

## Manage Your Energy

The key is completing the right tasks at the right time. During morning hours when we are full of energy we can focus on more creative task. In the evening when tired write emails etc.

## Log It

A lot of minor habits add up. To track them:
* commit to it
* write it down
* see result

## Excellence, Not Perfection

Part of achieving excellence is doing great work. Another part is doing it on time.
* Do it right the first time
* Give yourself a time limit
* Know when to stop
* Get feedback
